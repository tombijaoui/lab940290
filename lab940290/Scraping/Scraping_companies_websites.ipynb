Enrollment in Medicare Plus Blue, BCN Advantage and Prescription Blue depends on contract renewal.\\n\\nEvery year, Medicare evaluates plans based on a 5-star rating system. If you decide to have your plan premium withheld from your Social Security check or deducted from your checking or savings account, it may take up to three months for the automatic deduction to begin. If your premium amount is currently withheld from your Social Security check or deducted from your checking or savings account and you wish to receive a monthly bill instead, the change may also take up to three months to become effective. During this time, you will be responsible for paying your premium.\\n\\nOut-of-network/non-contracted providers are under no obligation to treat Medicare Plus Blue and BCN Advantage members, except in emergency situations. For a decision about whether we will cover an out-of-network service, we encourage you or your provider to ask us for a pre-service organization determination before you receive the service. Please call our customer service number or see your Evidence of Coverage for more information, including the cost-sharing that applies to out-of-network services.\\n\\nPremiums vary by county. You must continue to pay your Medicare Part B premium. You may enroll in only one Part D plan at a time.\\n\\nIn the event the Governor of your state, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of the United States declares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, be assured that Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Blue Care Network will continue to provide benefits based on the plan you are enrolled in. You will still be able to visit your doctor, urgent care facility or hospital if needed. Generally, during a disaster, your plan will allow you to obtain care from out-of-network providers at in-network cost-sharing. Our website will be updated if a disaster or public health emergency has occurred.\\n\\nFor more information, call the number on the back of your member ID card from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday, with weekend hours Oct. 1 through March 31.
