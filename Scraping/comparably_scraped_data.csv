Freelance Artist,"Freelance.com Mission, Vision & Values Freelance.com Mission & Values We structure and secure the relationships between companies and talented self-employed workers.Freelance.com Vision Statement We think that big companies are locomotives. For the economy: They engage the biggest projects. They structure the technological, methodological and commercial frameworks. They open huge markets to their suppliers.  For employability: The long-term vision and investment capacities of large companies make it possible to develop sustainable marketable expertise.  We believe that the majority of workers will be non-salaried. Deciding what to do: In the United States,  in 3 workers is freelance. It is not just a quest for freedom, but an aspiration to decide which topics to engage with time, skills and income.  Unmissable, expert and committed work force:  The income of non-employees depends solely on their know-how and the satisfaction of their customers. They represent a broader spectrum of skills than any structured enterprise. For all these reasons, they constitute a breeding ground today essential.  We believe that platform and human expertise are inseparable. Private Platform:  Large companies need a platform that adapts to their internal operating rules and tools. They are looking for skills related to their projects, which are therefore clearly identified - so they need a personalized platform that helps them to filter the most relevant profiles.  Experts in recruitment:  The placement of experts is an activity based on the match between a mission and a context on the one hand, and the best candidate (hard skills and soft skills) on the other hand. The exchange, the quality of the qualification, the consideration of the human are essential for a successful relationship.Freelance.com Mission, Vision & Values"

Freelance,"Freelance.com Mission, Vision & Values Freelance.com Mission & Values We structure and secure the relationships between companies and talented self-employed workers.Freelance.com Vision Statement We think that big companies are locomotives. For the economy: They engage the biggest projects. They structure the technological, methodological and commercial frameworks. They open huge markets to their suppliers.  For employability: The long-term vision and investment capacities of large companies make it possible to develop sustainable marketable expertise.  We believe that the majority of workers will be non-salaried. Deciding what to do: In the United States,  in 3 workers is freelance. It is not just a quest for freedom, but an aspiration to decide which topics to engage with time, skills and income.  Unmissable, expert and committed work force:  The income of non-employees depends solely on their know-how and the satisfaction of their customers. They represent a broader spectrum of skills than any structured enterprise. For all these reasons, they constitute a breeding ground today essential.  We believe that platform and human expertise are inseparable. Private Platform:  Large companies need a platform that adapts to their internal operating rules and tools. They are looking for skills related to their projects, which are therefore clearly identified - so they need a personalized platform that helps them to filter the most relevant profiles.  Experts in recruitment:  The placement of experts is an activity based on the match between a mission and a context on the one hand, and the best candidate (hard skills and soft skills) on the other hand. The exchange, the quality of the qualification, the consideration of the human are essential for a successful relationship.Freelance.com Mission, Vision & Values"
